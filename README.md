# Apple Picker

## Description
Developed in the Computational Intelligence course of the Computer Engineering program, "Apple Picker" is a game created in Python using the Pygame library. In this game, apples fall from the top of the screen, and the player (or an automated agent) must move a platform to catch the green apples and avoid the red ones. The goal is to maximize your score by catching green apples and avoiding red ones.

## Features
- **Green and Red Apples**: Green apples increase your score, while red apples decrease it.
- **Laser Sensors**: The platform is equipped with laser sensors to detect the position of the apples.
- **Automated Agent**: The game can be played manually or by using an automated agent that makes decisions based on sensor information.
